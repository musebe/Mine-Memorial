      <p class="title">From Mum and Dad</p>
      <p> 
        Mummy, time and season come and
go but for this one, we confess it
came unexpectedly and unwanted.
At times it feels unreal yet in others
the reality sinks that the Almighty
who had lent us to you demanded
that the lease was over and that
which was His had to be returned.
No appeal or plea that would make
him recede his decision. <br/>

We weep in remembrance of the
tough moments preceding your
departure but we are comforted on
the nostalgic recapturing of the
memorable moments shared in the
24 years that God granted us with
you. We are further comforted by the
knowledge that you are at a better
place.<br/><br/>
Mummy, we were inseparable, more
so to your mother who even people
used to ask “where is your handbag”
(referring to you” any time they saw
me without you). We cannot pretend
that your departure is inconsequential since the body may appear
strong but the soul is weak<br/><br/>
Fare thee well our daughter, for the
Lord will surely replenish that which
has been depleted<br/><br/>
We Love You So Much...

My dearest Lizzie,<br/>
I don't know where to begin because this all feels like a very very bad dream that I can't seem to wake up out of.<br/>
We were meant to do so much together. We had so much life ahead of us, or so we thought. We were meant to grow old together and our babies would be the best of friends and they would make fun of us every chance they'd get because of how corny we were.<br/>
You were a shining star. You were brave, you fought hard for who and what you believed in and that is why God couldn't wait to have you on his team because He got the best of the best; the sweetest earthly angel.<br/>
I will miss randomly meeting up and finding you in one of my tops or dresses and thinking "no wonder sijakua nikiona hii nguo". I'll miss all the birthdays you would plan for each one of us and the very thoughtful gifts you'd get us because you knew what we liked so well. I'll miss your soft voice, your infectious laugh, doing TikTok dances with you and the many many boomerangs we'd take any chance we got. <br/>
I'll miss you terribly but I know one day we'll be together again laugh- ing, joking, singing and dancing as we always did.<br/>
So, hold onto the ones you love and love on them tirelessly, love on them fearlessly and most of all, love on them unconditionally because we never know how much time we have and this home is only temporary.<br/><br/>
For now, rest well until we meet again my dearest angel.

Dear Lizzy,<br/>
I can't believe that it's been almost six years since I met you through Eva, my wife. It honestly feels longer thanforever. You were always warm and welcoming to anyone close and dear to your family, through Eva, I became your big brother. I will cherish your warm smile whenever Ellie smiles, I know she will dearly miss you and start asking of you soon. We shall keep your memory alive and always remind her of 'aunty Lizzy' (as she fondly referred to you).<br/> She has lost the benefit of your mentorship and girl talk, which I suspect had already begun. You have left in me a solid lesson to always celebrate all milestones,like nothing else matters. You remembered everyone's birth- days and made sure to bring all of us together. Ellie celebrated her birthday on 2nd April this year, and that's the only family event that you were not person- ally involved, your absence was loud. I know that heaven has gained an angel, with great recommendations from us, your family. We shall meet again and have one more bible verse trivia, I know I was horrible at it, but you promised that with time I will get better, game on sis.
Rest well lizzy. <br/>
Ken.

<p class="title">From Niece - ELLEWANAH </p>

<p>

My aunty Lizzie, oh how I will miss calling your name 100
times a day and you always
meeting me with the sweetest
smile a baby could ever wish for.<br/><br/>
I have known you since my birth
and I loved you like my mum
because you looked so much
like her, you talked like her, you
smelled like her, you were as
playful as she is and most of all
because you loved me with all
your heart.<br/> I will miss our walks to the shop where you would buy me candy and everything nice. You even taught me to say "how much" and "hallo shopkeeper "You truly played your role with the finest finesse.
I will miss you dearly aunty but mummy, daddy and I will keep your memory alive forever.
Your beloved niece, <br/>
Ellie

Our Dear Liz, <br/>
We thought of you with love today, but that is nothing new.It broke our hearts to lose you A beautiful friend, a sister, an amazing daughter. A part of us went with you the day God took you home. But as long as we're living, we'll carry you with us, safely tucked in our hearts. Your light will always shine. A glowing ember never stilled, throughout the end of time. Your memory is our keepsake with which we will never part. God has you in his keeping. We have you in our hearts. You meant so much to all of us. You were special and thats no lie. You brightened up the darkest days and the cloudiest skies. Always filled with love and happiness. So thank you for the time we had, the beautiful memories which we deeply and genuinely cherish<br/><br/>
Rest easy our Angel, be at peace, and let your soul fly free.
Till we meet again Lizzie, <br/><br/>
We love you deeply, <br/>
  Always and forever. <br/>
  From your best friends.
